I have a strong interest in digital signing, especially as applied to PDF documents.
In my personal projects, this mostly manifests in my work on <a href="https://github.com/MatthiasValvekens/pyHanko">pyHanko</a> (a PDF signing toolkit). I'm also an active participant in various collaborative projects and standardisation programmes in the digital documents space:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        I chaired the <a href="https://www.pdfa.org/community/digital-signature-twg/">PDF Digital Signatures Technical Working Group</a> in the PDF Association from January 2023 until December 2024.
    </li>
    <li>
        Together with some of my former colleagues from iText, I was part of the Belgian delegation to <a href="https://www.iso.org/committee/53674.html">ISO/TC&nbsp;171/SC&nbsp;2</a> from 2021 up to and including 2024.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
Besides contributing to the "core" PDF standard (ISO&nbsp;32000), I was also personally involved with the development of several published extension standards under SC&nbsp;2, both technically and as a project leader.
