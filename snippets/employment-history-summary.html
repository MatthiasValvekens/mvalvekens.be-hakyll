<p>
I'm currently employed as a Senior Scala Engineer at Centrica Business Solutions (formerly REstore) in Antwerp, and previously as a Research Engineer at iText in Ghent.
I was a researcher at KU Leuven from 2016 to 2020, where I completed my PhD in mathematics under the supervision of <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/stefaan-vaes">prof. Stefaan Vaes</a>.
My research centred around the representation theory of rigid C<sup>*</sup>-tensor categories, subfactor theory and quantum groups.

I'm also available for part-time consulting work related to digital documents and digital signatures, especially in connection with <a href="https://github.com/MatthiasValvekens">my open source work in that space</a>.
