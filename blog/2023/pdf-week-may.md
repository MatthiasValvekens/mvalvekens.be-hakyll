# May 2023: PDF Week

The [PDF Association](https://pdfa.org) is currently running a week-long event in Paris to discuss PDF standards & technology. The current round of meetings of [ISO/TC 171/SC 2](https://www.iso.org/committee/53674.html) is being held at the same time & venue.

I'm making the commute today to be there in-person for one day, to chair a meeting of the Association's Digital Signatures TWG. I'll also be attending a couple other sessions remotely later this week.

Hopefully we can make some solid progress on PDF standards, and maybe even get a few out the door this week!
