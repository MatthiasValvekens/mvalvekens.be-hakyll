# Summary

Last February, I gave a talk on PDF's security features at [FOSDEM '21](https://fosdem.org/2021/). The session was recorded, and is embedded below.
This was my first talk at a non-maths conference; take that as you will.

For further information, visit [the talk's info page](https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/safety_opensource_doc_security_pdf/).
