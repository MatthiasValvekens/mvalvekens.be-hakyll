# Summary

Around the end of September, I shared some of my ideas on how we could iterate on PDF's cryptographic feature set at the [2021 edition of the PDF Days](https://www.pdfa.org/pdf-days-online-2021/), organised by the [PDF Association](https://www.pdfa.org/).
Originally, this event was scheduled to take place in Berlin, but it got moved online due to COVID-related concerns. I've embedded the video below.

Right now, there is a lot of cryptography-related activity in the PDF community. This isn't limited to the PDF Association's technical working groups; cryptography is also a hot topic in the ISO and ETSI committees that work on PDF-related standards.\nThe primary goal of this talk is to frame some of that ongoing work, and share some of our ideas for the future of cryptography in PDF beyond that. PDF is not the only crypto-enabled digital format, and there's a lot that we can learn from the successes (and failures!) of other technologies.",
