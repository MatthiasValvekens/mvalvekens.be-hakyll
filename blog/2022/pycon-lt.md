# First in-person conference in a while

I was invited to speak at [PyCon LT 2022](https://www.pycon.lt/).
Right now, I'm getting on a plane for the first time in over two years. The last time I gave an in-person talk at a conference was back in late 2019. It's been a while...

The topic for tomorrow is FOSS and PKI; have a look at the [talk description page](https://pretalx.com/pycon-lt-2022/talk/B9TMAN/) for more information.
