This series of posts documents my observations on PDF as implemented "out there". The topics I cover in this series are merely things I consider interesting and/or useful to document.

_Disclaimer:_ All of this is my personal opinion, and doesn't represent any kind of industry consensus whatsoever, nor do I claim to represent my employer's position.

For the uninitiated: The series title _PDF as She Is Wrote_ is a nod to [this gem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_as_She_Is_Spoke).
