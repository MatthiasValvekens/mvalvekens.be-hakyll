# Boggle

A fairly basic Boggle clone with a Bulma-based user interface and a server running on top of Flask. Communication between client and server happens through a very simple JSON API.
Goal: provide some responsible family entertainment during the coronavirus crisis.<br/>
If you're up for it, give <a href="/boggle/">my hosted Boggle instance</a> a spin.
